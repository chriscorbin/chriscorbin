Hello, My name is Chris!

Programmer, Database Wrangler, Automation Enthusiast!

You may be thinking to yourself: "Wow, this github account is a little new and a lot empty." Well, yes. I have built a ton of cool stuff over the years for my current employer, however, as they are a medical company with many NDAs and BAAs in effect, none of it is able to be published as public. I created this Github to show off my personal projects and contribute to the open source community.

If you have any more questions, you can check out my [website](https://iamchriscorbin.com/)


Here are a few fun facts about me:

I work as a fulltime Data Engineer for an awesome company out of California.

I currently do a little bit of freelance work, provided there are no conflicts with my day-job.

I write a few blog posts every now and then on my website, feel free to check them out.

My favorite animal is the Capybara.
