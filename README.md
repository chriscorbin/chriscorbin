Hello, My name is Chris!

Programmer, Database Wrangler, Automation Enthusiast!

You may be thinking to yourself: "Wow, this github account is a little new and a lot empty." Well, yes. I have built a ton of cool stuff over the years for my current employer, however, as they are a medical company with many NDAs and BAAs in effect, none of it is able to be published as public. I created this Github to show off my personal projects and contribute to the open source community.

If you have any more questions, you can check out my [website](https://iamchriscorbin.com/)


Here are a few fun facts about me:

    I work as a fulltime Data Engineer for an awesome company out of California. If you want to learn more, my resume is available.

    I have a number of cool projects that I work on (at least I think theyâ€™re cool).

    I currently do a little bit of freeelance work, provided there is no conflict with my fulltime job.

    I write a few blog posts every now and then when something is on my mind, feel free to peruse at your leisure.

    My favorite animal is the capybara.
